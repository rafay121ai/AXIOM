# Lessons

- Destructive migrations that still have runtime dependencies belong outside `supabase/migrations/`. Keep them under `supabase/pending/` until code cleanup is merged and deployed and a data backup is verified.
- Do not remove denormalized session fields only because a replacement table exists. Confirm every runtime reader first; `sessions.pillar_weights` still drives RAG routing.
